Personal Notes & Bookmark Manager is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB or PostgreSQL, Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to efficiently manage personal notes and bookmarks in one place. The application provides complete CRUD functionality for notes and bookmarks, supports tagging, text-based search, and filtering using query parameters, and includes proper input validation, URL validation for bookmarks, meaningful HTTP status codes, and structured error handling. Users can save notes with titles, content, and tags, and store bookmarks with URLs, titles, descriptions, and tags, with an optional feature to automatically fetch bookmark titles from URLs when not provided. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface, featuring dedicated pages for notes and bookmarks, real-time search, tag filtering, and optional favorite marking. The backend exposes RESTful APIs under /api/notes and /api/bookmarks, follows a modular folder structure, and is designed for scalability and maintainability. Bonus functionality includes JWT-based authentication to restrict data access to logged-in users and allow users to manage only their own notes and bookmarks. This project demonstrates real-world REST API design, database modeling, validation and error handling, modern React development, responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS, and clear project documentation with setup instructions and sample API usage.
